    <h1>Wisconsin Beer Brats</h1>
    <img src="/Users/lhaymore/odin-links-and-images/images/brats.jpg" alt="Beautifully grilled bratwursts"> 
    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Listen, Wisconsin is one of the most underrated states in the contiguous 48. Beer, squeaky cheese curds,
           the Packers, the Brewers, Kopps Custard, the list goes on. But <em>nothing</em> beats a brat fresh off the 
           grill at Miller Park, and a crisp Miller Lite while the Brewers get their butt kicked! (Hey, it is what it is.)  
        </p>
        <p>I know not everybody has the benefit of living in or near Wisconsin, so I have found the best brat recipe to bring
            a bit of home to you. So crack open a cold one this football season, and cook up some Wisconsin brats. You deserve it!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2lbs fresh bratwurst sausages</li>
            <li>6 (12 fluid oz) cans or bottles of beer</li>
            <li>2 onions, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 cup butter</li>
            <li>1 1/2tsp ground black pepper</li>
            <li>10 hoagie rolls</li>
        </ul><br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prick bratwurst with a fork to prevent them from exploding as they cook; place in a large stockpot. Add beer, 
                onions, butter, and black pepper. Place the stockpot over medium heat, bring to a boil and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat an outdoor grill for mid-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
            </li>
            <li>Cook bratwurst on the preheated grill until evenly browned, about 10 to 14 minutes, turning occasionally. Serve hot 
                off the grill with onions on hoagie rolls.
            </li>
        </ol>
