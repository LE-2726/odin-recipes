    <h3>Desctiption</h3>
        <p>Dahi Machi is a healing dish of delicate white fish lightly fried 
            and set in a velvety yogurt sauce. While fish and yogurt may not be the first
            thing on many American minds, don't knock it til you try it!</p>
        <p>This recipe comes from a book given to me as a gift from a dear friend many years back.
            The original author of this blessed recipe is a Ms. Julie Sahni. I hope you enjoy it as 
            much as I have.</p><br>

        <ul>
            <li>1lb skinless, boneless haddock fillets</li>
            <li> 8tbsp light vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups finely chopped onions</li>
            <li>1 1/2tbsp finely chopped fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>1/8tsp turmeric</li>
            <li>3/4tsp Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Small pinch each of ground cinnamon and clove</li>

            <li>2tbsp finely chopped fresh coriander leaves</li>
            <li>2-4 green chilies, seeded and minced</li>
        </ul><br>    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse with cold water and pat dry the haddock fillets then cut them
                into 1 inch by 2 inch pieces and set aside
            </li>
            <li>Heat 3 or 4 tablespoons of oil in a large non-stick pan over mid heat.
                Dust the fillets with flour, and add them to the pan in one layer. Fry until 
                golden brown on all sides. Don't overcook. After having fried all fish pieces,
                set them to the side on a platter. 
            </li>
            <li>Add remaining oil to the pan with onions. Fry until butterscotch in color, stirring
                frequently so as not to char or burn them. (Abt 15min) Add ginger, fry a minute, then
                add turmeric, cinnamon, salt, and clove, stirring rapidly for 15 seconds. Add yogurt
                and turn off heat.
            </li>
            <li>Pour onion mixture into a blender or food processor, and blend to a puree. Return sauce to pan
                and bring to a gentle simmer over low heat. Add the cooked fish pieces and simmer covered for an 
                additional 3 minutes. Serve sprinkled with coriander leaves and chilies. 
            </li>
        </ol>
