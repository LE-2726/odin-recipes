            <li>1tsp baking soda</li>
            <li> 1/4tsp salt</li>

            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 
                9x5 in loaf pan
            </li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt. In a separate bowl, 
                cream together butter and brown sugar. Stir in eggs and mashed bananas until 
                well blended. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture; stir just to moisten.

            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 65 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into 
                center of the loaf comes out clean. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then 
                turn out onto a wire rack.
